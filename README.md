# :apple: :banana: Fruit Recognition Deep Learning Model :watermelon: :pear:

This project was completed as part of a university class at PUC-RIO University. The project was assigned as part of a class Bootcamp/Competition that lasted for a couple of months. My model placed second with an accuracy of approximately 93%.

The program was written on a Google Colab notebook and the model was trained on approximately 27,000 fruit images, which belonged to 13 different fruit categories:

- :apple:
- :banana:
- :pear:
- :pineapple:
- :grapes:
- :cherries:
- :peach:
- :lemon:
- :coconut:
- :mango:
- :watermelon:
- :orange:
- :strawberry:

Note: The image files could not be uploaded to this repo since their zipped size exceeded the 25MB limit. But the links to the Google Drive folders with the datasets can be accessed through the links below:
