# :apple: :banana: Fruit Recognition Deep Learning Model :watermelon: :pear:

This is a deep learning model trained to categorize fruit images. The program was written on a Google Colab notebook and the model was trained on approximately 27,000 fruit images. 

This project was completed as part of a university class at PUC-RIO University. The project was assigned as part of a class Bootcamp/Competition that lasted for a couple of months. My model placed second with an accuracy of approximately 93%.
